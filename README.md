# LABORATORY

This repository is just my little laboratory for testing without any consequence.
This is my way to lean and try new concepts or to improve my knowledge on a particular technology. Some of the test you might find here does not make sense at all, stupid or even has laready been implemented and describe in the documentation of the language. Basically, I made this repository for answering my favorite questions :

* Is it possible to do this ?
* Is it better to do that instead of that ?
* What is the best way to do this ?
* How does it work ?

Most of the technology I experiment with I already worked professionally with all of them. But it's hard to learn a technology at 100% while working with it and since the technologies evolve fast I take my spare time to read the documentation. This way I fill up the gap missing in my knowledge.
